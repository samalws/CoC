# Minitrue
Minitrue is a minimalist [calculus of constructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_constructions) typechecker (i.e., proof checker) written in Haskell.
It contains the bare minimum syntax necessary to prove anything in mathematics.
Its name comes both from the fact that it is a minimalist (mini) proof checker (true), and from the shortened name of the
[Ministry of Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministries_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four#Ministry_of_Truth),
the ministry in *1984* tasked with deciding what is true and what isn't.
